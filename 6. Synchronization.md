# Synchronization

## Intro
Welcome to the end game. You might have thought that there were a lot of corners cut and compromises just because the system can afford them. Well here are more corners to be cut and in the end it's such a small (31 lines) code that just works so I don't mind being minimalist with lines. Speaking of which, off to the topic.

## Notes on Synchornization
The biggest advantage we have to simplifying the synchronization library is that this is a non preemptive kernel. That means if we don't give up control willingly the OS won't snatch it away from us. All the fuss about making operations atomic and making sure you don't get interrupted after checking a condition go out the window.  

With that in mind, we can implement the simplest mutexs and semaphores with integers and while loops without touching assembly. Simple C that works. 

Yeah that's pretty much it, nothing on this section.

## Pitfalls
- Make sure you're not busy waiting, give up control of the cpu if the mutex can not be locked at the moment.
