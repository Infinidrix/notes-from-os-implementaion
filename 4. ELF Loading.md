# ELF Loading
## Intro
Welcome to the hardest part of the kernel (personally), where we take the compiled and linked user code (program.c) and load it in the specified memory locations and jump into the main function.

## Notes on ELF Loading Implementation
The good thing about this that there is a lot of good resources on this online, from a simple [guide](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~aburtsev/238P/hw/hw3-elf/hw3-elf.html) to the full elf [spec](http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf). The `elf.h` file given for the assignment becomes extra useful when you're finally parsing the ELF.

    - When it comes to implementing it, read enough of the specs until the section and program headers make sense then go over to coding checking every little bit as you go



## Pitfalls
- Check the magic and make sure that it is the sequence 0x7f, 'E', 'L', 'F'
    * My user ELF started a bit earlier than I expected and I had to adjust the program start based off that
- Make sure you have a hex editor
    * 010 editor has nice templates you can see what the actual structure of the ELF is like for debugging
- Have print functions for program and section headers
   * They will be super useful for debugging and checking if you are parsing the elf right
- Make sure to link before adding it to os-image
    * `ld --Ttext 0x07048000 -m elf_i386 --oformat elf32-i386 -o OUTPUT INPUTS` should do the trick
- If at some point the output is just all zeros, Load more blocks from the entry.s code when it calls your disk load funtion.
    * Check by printing your section headers and if it's all zeros and your hex editor says it isn't then increase the number of sectors you're reading to memory.
- Make sure to link it far from kernel 
    * For the `--Ttext CONSTANT` make sure the constant is a really big number so it doesn't interfere with the kernel code and stack.
- After storing the segments in the right memory, in order to just test that the code so far works, you can add a small user_entry.s just like the kernel_entry.s that has a _start that calls main and just returns
    * Finding and calling main is its own thing and you can avoid debugging two things at once by testing this first and then moving on to find and jumping to the main function.
- If you're looking for materials to read from, you can safely avoid the complex parts and just read about __Loading Static binaries__ with __no relocations__
