# Screen Driver
Thankfully for the screen driver, the book given by the class, os-dev.pdf (TODO: provide proper attribution) has the code necessary to implement it. The codes required for this assignment starts from the code block on page 64. Read from section 6.1.2 to understand what the functions do (TL;DR version is that the functions read data from and write data to the screen using ports).

*Don't copy paste code from there directly sometimes there's an error from the pdf's styling.*

For the actual implementation of the screen driver, there is section 6.2 on page 65 of the book. Recommend reading the descriptions because some of the code samples are wrong. By wrong, I mean some of the code blocks are cut without finishing (set_cursor function on page 68) and a function (get_offset I think) is missing. The fixes are easy once you read the descriptions. 

*make sure the screen driver is working properly before continuing on because a lot of debugging in the future is going to be using that*

*Side note: Check out https://wiki.osdev.org/Text_UI if you want to add additional colors like:* 

    #define BLACK_ON_WHITE 0xf0
    #define YELLOW_ON_BLUE 0x1e
