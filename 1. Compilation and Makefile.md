# Compiling stuff and Makefiles
## Compilation process 
For the rest of this assignment, we're (mostly) not going to touch boot related stuff (src/boot/) so no need to alter the compilation process there.
For the others, each .c file will be compiled separately like:

`gcc -ffreestanding -c -m32 -fno-pie every_file.c -o every_file.o`

*-fstack-protector seems to generate an error somewhere so I just dropped that (will look into it later maybe)*

Then for the kernel files they'll be linked together into one kernel.bin file (command on assignment2.pdf file). Afterwards you'll just take the first 5kB of the input and leave the rest with a command similar to the one we used for boot_trimmed.bin. 

For the user files, they'll be linked with the command given on the assignment2.pdf doc. 

All 3 of them, boot.bin, kernel.bin and user will be merged together into os-image in that order.

You can create a Makefile to automate that and resources that helped me with this were: 
- https://makefiletutorial.com (Right up until Static Pattern Rules and Filter is good)
- https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf (Has a quick reference section on page 185, if you're looking for something specific)

**To make things easier when you start writing the makefile, you can have the .o files be in the src directory instead of trying to get them into the build directory. Have it work first, then try to make it work correctly.*
