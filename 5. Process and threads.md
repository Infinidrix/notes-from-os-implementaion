# Process and Threads

## Intro
If you've implemented the ELF loader, then welcome; it's been a hell of a ride. If you haven't, then trust me you're not missing anything. When it comes to process and threads, there isn't one absolute right way to do it. You can look at the program.c supplied and think of the easiest way to implement the functionality that is required or you can go all out and build something robust and great. I chose the first option.

## Heads up
There is a tiny bit of assembly in here so brace yourselves.

## Concepts of Program and threads implementation
First thing first, we merged the two. We only have a single user program and there is no concept of files, input devices, heap and security. That means there's no information to store about a process that's unique than that of a thread. The saved states are the stack, registers and program counter.    

We can go a bit further than that with what we've been informed in the assignment. Threads are created using thread_create and then yield control via thread_yield so that means that there are function calls involved. The compiler doesn't expect the registers to be saved when you return from a function call so there's no need to save the registers, and additionally we know that the return address is stored at `ebp + 4` when a function is called so if we have the stack pointers (`esp` and `ebp`) we can easily access the return address and therefore the program counter. 

So with all that we've brought down the threads' (and processes') state down to (`esp` and `ebp`). With that in mind, it'll be good to keep track of what state a thread is in (Running, ready, ..., etc) but that's maybe extra. Now we just need something to store those informations in when a thread is created. The simplest option would be an array... so yeah an array of thread states (of which our one user program is a part of).

Once those are out of the way, you can start thinking about how threads could be created and paused and destoryed. The main thing to think is that the only thing different with each one is the stack. Start with created. What can happen there? A new thread is being created so it makes sense that a new item is going to be added to the array of threads. What value are we going to put for ebp and esp? Then what? Should we jump into the function with this thread? Then we should probably change the state of the thread that just called from Running to paused or something.  

That handles part of create, how about when a thread_yield is called? This one sounds simple enough, change the state of this one and start the next available one. On the topic of changing state from running one thread to another, how do you actually do that. Remember that the only difference between threads is their stack, that's the only thing we're keeping in the stack. So if we use some assembly and set the `esp` and `ebp` to be the values we saved, then we're in the new thread's stack all of a sudden.

Imagine you're thread 1, and you call thread_yield. The kernel saves that ebp and esp and goes on it's normal life. When the fated moment comes and it's your turn to run, the OS sets the ebp and esp. But how is it going to get to the exact line you were paused at? You called a function right, so all the OS has to do is return from that function, then since the return address is saved on the stack it'll return to the line it's supposed to.

Hope that made sense, since that's all the typing I'll dedicate to it. That's basically only my approach to it. You can have yours and have it be just as valid, if not better than this. Have fun! 

## Pitfalls
- Teacher showed us how to call assembly from c and you can use that to make the context switches and such but I really recommend taking some time to read a bit about gcc inline assembly since it'll make like really easy. Basically `asm(Instruction
        : outputs
        : inputs);`
    
- Where is the kernel stack? When you're going around saving the stack of every thread don't forget to keep track of the kernel's stack so that you can do something else if all your threads have finished
    * You can test that by having the main kernel method print something after calling the function that jumps into the user main function (the ELF Loader) 
- pthread_exit isn't the only way to exit. A thread might return from its main function. That's a weird case to handle for so make sure you have taken the necessary steps to make exiting by pthread_exit and returning from the main function act the same way.
- I have no idea why but we had to increase the size of our kernel is os-image. 
    * If you are having crashes after writing a bunch of code then try commenting out a bunch of code somewhere else in the kernel and if that seems to fix it, then you might have this issue
    * If you increase the kernel size, then don't forget to adjust the user program offset and the number of sectors loaded from disk
